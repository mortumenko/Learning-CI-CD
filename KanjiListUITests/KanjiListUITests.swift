/*
 Setting Up snapshot
  + 1. Create a new UI Test target in your Xcode project (See the top part of this article)
  + 2. Run fastlane snapshot init in your project folder
  + 3. Add the ./SnapshotHelper.swift file to your UI Test target (You can move the file anywhere you want)
  + 4. Add a new Xcode scheme for the newly created UI Test target
  + 5. Edit the scheme
  + 6. In the list on the left click "Build", and enable the checkbox under the "Run" column for your target.
  + 7. Enable the Shared box of the newly created scheme
8. (Objective C only) Add the bridging header to your test class.
 #import "MYUITests-Swift.h"
 The bridging header is named after your test target with -Swift.h appended.
9. In your UI Test class, click the Record button on the bottom left and record your interaction
10. To take a screenshot, call the following between interactions
 Swift: snapshot("01LoginScreen")
 Objective C: [Snapshot snapshot:@"01LoginScreen" timeWaitingForIdle:10];
  + 11. Add the following code to your setUp() method:
  + 12. In the terminal run fastlane snapshot.
